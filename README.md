# Inspiration
Inspired by technologies like AI, AR and the interactive gaming experiences they provide. This was an experimental project based on AR, ML and image detection. We wanted to build a mobile application

# What it does
We have developed this project to make quarantine time more productive and engage yourself with things around you. It is an educational quest for kids through solve through levels of cryptic riddles that contain information and are representative of the common things around them such as environment, animals, electronics, etc.

# How we built it
Android application is built with flutter. For the login, storage of leaderboard, etc we used firebase. Image detection is implemented using TensorFlow Lite. Augmented Reality is achieved using EchoAR and rendered in Unity.

# Challenges we ran into
We were beginners in mobile development and particularly new to technology such as ML. In our quest to find the best technology stack for the project, we were introduced to novel software such as EchoAR, in which we did not possess any prior experience. We stumbled at several stages of production and the application is still not fully developed.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have achieved success in training and building our ML model that accurately predicts the required result. As required we have prototyped the app and applied AR.

# What we learned
We have gained a thorough understanding of working and application of AR, image processing, mobile app development with flutter. We are now comfortable in debugging and deploying application built with these.

# What's next for Treasure Hunt
We wish to expand the application by allowing users to create their own quests.
